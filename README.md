## ℹ️ About this project

This is a solo project that is a part of [Scrimba's Learn JavaScript Course](https://scrimba.com/learn/learnjavascript) by Per Harald Borgen.

At the end of every module, there's a solo project to practise all the concepts that were taught .

Every solo project has a list of features that need to be on the project, and a [Figma design](https://www.figma.com/file/NEj9JDycMjF3XKXq7swoc9/Random-Password-Generator-(New-version)?node-id=0%3A1) to replicate.

In this project I had to create a Password Generator, with 15 random characters.

The main goal of the project was to practise how to use `Math.floor()` `Math.random()` and `For loops`.

## 🧰 Technologies used

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

## ✅ Solo Project Requirements

- `Build  from scratch`
- `Generate two random passwords when the user clicks the button`
- `Each password should be 15 characters long`

## 💡 How this project was created

- Created an HTML file to display the items and style the page acoording to the Figma file
- Created an array with characters
- Added two variables to select the items on the HTML file where I want to display the generated passwords
- Added the function getPasswords() that will be called when clicking the button `Generate Passwords`
- Created for loop indicating I want to loop 15 times over the characters array in a random order and display them on the page

## 🧠 Improvement ideas
- I'd like to come back to this project and add a feature to copy the password with a click
